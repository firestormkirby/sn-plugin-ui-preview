 * the note page's pixel size, which is exactly what `contextStore.derivePageSize()`
 * relies on. In a browser they describe the desktop the harness happens to be
 * running on, so the page size came out as some fraction of a monitor.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic error. `screenToPagePoint` fits the page inside the
 * tap container with `containedBounds`, preserving aspect ratio, so a page
 * whose shape does not match the screen gets letterboxed, and every tap in
 * the resulting bars clamps to the page edge. It reads as an invisible margin
 * down the left and right that nothing can be placed past.
 *
 * The iframe IS the device screen, so 'screen' is the viewport and the ratio
 * is 1: one CSS pixel is one page pixel, which also makes the whole preview
 * 1:1 with the coordinates the UI stores.
