/**
 * react-native-web ships no type declarations.
 *
 * A shorthand `declare module 'react-native-web';` would type the whole module
 * as `any`, and `export *` from an `any` module re-exports NOTHING — so every
 * `import { View } from 'react-native'` in your plugin would fail to resolve.
 * The names therefore have to be listed.
 *
 * This is not type safety and does not pretend to be: each export is `any`, and
 * the real checking of your components happens in your own repo against the
 * real React Native types. It exists so a `tsc` run here is quiet.
 *
 * If your plugin imports a component that is not listed, add it. That is
 * expected maintenance, not a bug.
